## What is PHP?

PHP is a **general purpose server side scripting language** that we can use to develop dynamic web sites and applications. PHP only needs to be **installed on the web server** that will host the web application and **client applications** can **access** the **server resources** via **web browsers**. The diagram shown below illustrates the basic architecture of a PHP web application. (Reference: https://www.guru99.com/php-practical-example.html)

- PHP is an acronym for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor"
- PHP is a widely-used, open source scripting language
- PHP scripts are executed on the server
- PHP is free to download and use
    
!> PHP is an amazing and popular language!

- It is powerful enough to be at the core of the biggest blogging system on the web (WordPress)!
- It is deep enough to run the largest social network (Facebook)!
- It is also easy enough to be a beginner's first server side language!
    
## What you should already know

Before you continue you should have a basic understanding of the following:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- MySQL 

## What is a PHP file?

- PHP files can contain text, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP code
- PHP code are executed on the server, and the result is returned to the browser as plain HTML
- PHP files have extension ".php"

## What can PHP do?

- PHP can generate dynamic page content
- PHP can create, open, read, write, delete, and close files on the server
- PHP can collect form data
- PHP can send and receive cookies
- PHP can add, delete, modify data in your database
- PHP can be used to control user-access

!> With PHP you are not limited to output HTML. You can output images, PDF files, and even Flash movies. You can also output any text, such as XHTML and XML.

## Why PHP?

You have obviously head of a number of programming languages out there; you may be wondering why we would want to use PHP over other languages? PHP just like MySQL is **open source and free**, you don't need to pay for you to get PHP; all you have to do is download it. Packages such as **XAMPP** come bundled already with a web server, MySQL and PHP among others. This is also unbelievably free. This makes PHP a cost effective choice compared to other scripting languages such as CFML or ASP.

Other benefit that you get with PHP is that it's a **server side scripting language**; this means you only need to install it on the server and client computers requesting for the resources from the server do not need to have PHP installed; only a web browser would be enough.

PHP also has **in built support for working hand in hand with MySQL**; this doesn't mean you can't use PHP with other database management systems.

PHP is **cross platform** which means you can deploy your application on a number of different operating systems such as windows, Linux, Mac OS etc. (Reference: https://www.guru99.com/php-practical-example.html)

- PHP runs on various platforms (Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc.)
- PHP is compatible with almost all servers used today (Apache, IIS, etc.)
- PHP supports a wide range of databases
- PHP is free. Download it from the official PHP resource: www.php.net
- PHP is easy to learn and runs efficiently on the server side

## What Do I Need?
  
To start using PHP, you can:

- Find a web host with PHP and MySQL support
- Install a web server on your own PC, and then install PHP and MySQL

## Use a Web Host With PHP Support

If your server has activated support for PHP you do not need to do anything.

Just create some .php files, place them in your web directory, and the server will automatically parse them for you.

You do not need to compile anything or install any extra tools.

Because PHP is free, most web hosts offer PHP support.

## Set Up PHP on Your Own PC

However, if your server does not support PHP, you must:

- install a web server
- install PHP
- install a database, such as MySQL
- OR install XAMPP (most popular PHP Development Environment)

!> XAMPP is a free and open-source cross-platform web server solution stack package developed by Apache Friends, consisting mainly of the Apache HTTP Server, MariaDB database, and interpreters for scripts written in the PHP and Perl programming languages. Get installer here: https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html

The official PHP website (PHP.net) has installation instructions for PHP: http://php.net/manual/en/install.php
