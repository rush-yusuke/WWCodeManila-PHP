Ever needed custom formatted sample / test data, like, bad? Well, that's the idea of this script. It's a free, open source tool written in JavaScript, PHP and MySQL that lets you quickly generate large volumes of custom data in a variety of formats for use in testing software, populating databases, and... so on and so forth.

This site also offers an online demo where you're welcome to tinker around to get a sense of what the script does, what features it offers and how it works. Then, once you've whet your appetite, there's a free, fully functional, GNU-licensed version available for download. Alternatively, if you want to avoid the hassle of setting it up on your own server, you can donate $20 or more to get an account on the site, letting you generate up to 5,000 records at a time (instead of the maximum 100), and let you save your data sets.
